# Building the mini-Internet

This folder contains scripts to get the mini-Internet up and running.

If you are curious, check out the scripts to find out what they are doing!

Concretely, we have:

- `topo/`: The configuration for the mini-Internet platform, e.g. which devices to use and how to connect them.
- `default_config/`: The initial commands to send to each device to set up the interfaces and addresses for this exercise.
- `./build.sh` and `./cleanup.sh`: Scripts to easily create/tear down the mini-Internet.
