# Communication Networks course

In this folder, you can find our 2019 and 2020 assignments that we used for the mini-Internet project. Note that for the 2019 iteration of the mini-Internet project, we used another implementation of the mini-Internet based on VMs instead of docker containers for virtualization. We include it only to show the topology and the questions we asked to our students. For anything else, it is preferable to look at the assignment from 2020.

- The config files for the mini-Internet we used in 2020 are available [here](../platform/config_2020).
- The config files for the mini-Internet we used in 2019 are available [here](../platform/config_2019).
