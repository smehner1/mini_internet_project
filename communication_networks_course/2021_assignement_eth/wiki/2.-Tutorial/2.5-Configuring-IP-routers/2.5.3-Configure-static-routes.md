OSPF and BGP are dynamic routing protocols which will automatically route
around network failures. In some cases though, it is useful to define routes
**statically**. Static routes are set once and for all, independently of the
network conditions. Static routes are simply configured by specifying
the IP prefix along with the IP next-hop. As an illustration:

```
router# conf t
router(config)# ip route 3.0.0.0/24 2.0.0.2
```

would force the router to direct all traffic destined to `3.0.0.0/24` to `2.0.0.2`.
You can verify that a static route has been installed correctly using
`show ip route static`:

```
router# show ip route static
S   3.0.0.0/24 [1/0] via 2.0.0.2 inactive
```
