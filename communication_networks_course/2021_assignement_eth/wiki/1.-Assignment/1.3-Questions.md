The assignment is split in the following three parts:

1.  [Intra-domain routing](#intra-domain-routing-4-points). In the first part you establish connectivity within your network (intra-domain).
    You will start by configuring the layer-2 network in your two data centers,
    followed by setting up OSPF and 6in4 tunnels between the two Data Centers.

2.  [Inter-domain routing](#inter-domain-routing-15-point).  The second part is all about interconnecting all the networks
    (inter-domain). It involves configuring your iBGP sessions, bringing your eBGP sessions with your neighboring ASes up and advertising your prefixes. 

3.  [Policy routing](#policy-routing-45-points-05-bonus-points). The third and last part involves implementing your BGP policies according to 
    the business relationships that you have with your neighbors. In addition to 
    these three parts, there is also one bonus question related to VPN.


To help you with project, we explain in the tutorial section how to configure your [hosts](../2.-Tutorial/2.2-Configuring-a-host), [switches](../2.-Tutorial/2.3-Configuring-Open-vSwitch), [IPv6 tunnels](../2.-Tutorial/2.4-Configure-6in4-tunnels), as well as [routers](../2.-Tutorial/2.5-Configuring-IP-routers/2.5.1-The-FRRouting-CLI).
For each question, we precisely tell you what you must include in your report. Take a close look at the [submission instructions](../1.-Assignment/1.1-General-Instructions#submission-instructions) to see how you should submit your work.

### Intra-Domain Routing (4 points)


#### Question 1.1 (1.25 point)

Your goal for this question is to enable direct layer-2 connectivity in Data Center 1
between the `SpaceX` hosts, between the `NASA` hosts, but not in between them.
Yet, `SpaceX` hosts and `NASA` hosts in Data Center 1 should still
be able to communicate between
themselves, but via a layer-3 router. This will prevent
typical layer-2 attacks such as MAC spoofing used to impersonate a type of user
and get access to sensitive data. To do that, you will have to configure, in each Data Center, the hosts, the switches, and the routers directly connected to the Data Center.

_Configure the IP addresses and default gateway:_ To enable end-to-end connectivity in Data Center 1, you will need to configure an IPv4 address
as well as a default gateway on each host of each company, and on the interfaces of the routers `NEWY` and `BROO` connected to the Data Center.
For this question, you must use the IPv4 subnet `X.200.0.0/23`
where X is your group number (you do not have to configure IPv6 addresses for this question).
You are free to use any IP address as long as it is in that subnet.
To test connectivity, you can use `ping`.

In addition, every host needs to have an IPv4 default gateway to be able to reach external destinations. Configure it such that all hosts in Data Center 1 use `NEWY` as standard gateway.

_Configure the VLANs:_ You also have to configure VLANs: use VLAN 10 for `SpaceX` and VLAN 20 for `NASA`. 
VLAN 30 is reserved for later use. To configure VLANs, you will have to configure tagged and trunk ports on the switches. We explain how to do that in our tutorial.

:point_right: The interface of `NEWY`
connected to Data Center 1 in VLAN 10 is named `NEWY-L2.10`, and the one in
VLAN 20 is named `NEWY-L2.20` (you can see them with a `show interface brief`
in the FRRouting CLI). The same convention is used for the interfaces in `BROO`.
Do not use the interfaces `NEWY-L2` in the router `NEWY` and the interface `BROO-L2` in 
the router `BROO`.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Explain what IP addresses you 
assigned to the different hosts in each Data Center. Finally, show the output for one `traceroute` from `SpaceX_1` to `SpaceX_3` and one from `SpaceX_1` to `NASA_3`. 
In a few sentences, explain what you observe.

_Hint:_ Use `traceroute` with the option `-n` to prevent traceroute from trying to translate the IP addresses to the respective domain names. This does not yet work, as DNS is not yet configured.

#### Question 1.2 (0.5 point)

Configure OSPF network-wide by establishing OSPF adjacencies between neighboring
routers. Then, make sure to advertise all your IPv4 subnets (including the one in Data Center 1)
into OSPF so as to enable end-to-end connectivity
between all the hosts in your AS.

> Obviously you will not have connectivity with the hosts in Data Center 2 as they currently have no IP addresses.

Before configuring OSPF, you will have to configure all the IP
addresses on each interface of your routers and their directly connected host.
Unlike for Question 1.1, 
you must use the IP addresses shown in the [L3 topology](1.2-Your-mini-Internet#l3-topology).
For the router interfaces between `PITT` and `DETR`, for example, you have to use the
subnet `X.0.7.0/24`. The interface in `PITT` that is connected to `DETR` must have
the IP address `X.0.7.1` and the interface in `DETR` that is connected to `PITT` must
have the IP address `X.0.7.2` (where X is your group number).

Every router also has a loopback interface with the name `lo` that you have to configure. The router
with ID Y has the loopback address `X.[150+Y].0.1/24` where X is your group number
(router IDs are shown on each router, for example the ID of `CHIC` is 6).
As an example, the loopback address of the router `CHIC` for the group 10 is
`10.156.0.1/24`.

For the connection between the routers and their corresponding host,
you have to use the subnet `X.[100+Y].0.0/24`, where X is your group number,
and Y is the ID of the router. Then, the host gets the IP address `X.[100+Y].0.1` and the
interface of the router that is connected to this host will have the IP address
`X.[100+Y].0.2`. For example, the subnet used for group 85 between the `CHAR` router and 
the corresponding host is `85.103.0.0/24`. The interface at the router `CHAR` that is 
connected to the host, is called `host` and uses `85.103.0.2/24`. The interface 
of the host connected to the router is called `CHARrouter` and uses the IP address `85.103.0.1/24`.

Be sure that each host can ping its directly connected router. Then,
you can start configuring OSPF.

Verify that the subnet of the DNS server and the measurement
container are visible in OSPF (for instance with `show ip route ospf`). 
We give more detail about the DNS server and the measurement container in the [tools](1.4-Tools-to-help-you) section.

> Do not modify the `dns` interface on `DETR`, the `measurement` interface on `NASH`, and the `matrix` interface on `CHAR`. 

From now on, always prefer to launch
`traceroute` from the hosts because they can use the DNS service (routers cannot).
If one host cannot access the DNS server because the OSPF configuration is not ready
yet, run `traceroute` with the option `-n` so that it does not
try to translate each IP address found on the path.


:pencil: **To include in your report:** Include the result of a `traceroute` from `CHAR-host` to `DETR-host`.

#### Question 1.3 (0.5 point)

As a network operator, your goal is now to provide the best performance to your
customers. Here in particular, you expect a lot of traffic between provider 1
which is connected to `CHIC` and customer 1 which is connected to `NASH`. Besides, 
the links `STLO`-`PITT` and `PITT`-`NEWY` will be used for the traffic between the two
Data-Centers (you will configure that in Question 1.4). As a result,
for now you want them to be used only as backup, in case another link in your network fails.

To do so, you must configure OSPF weights such that the traffic between `CHIC` and `NASH` is
loadbalanced on the following three paths (and only those ones): `CHIC`-`STLO`-`NASH`, `CHIC`-`DETR`-`PITT`-`NASH` and 
`CHIC`-`DETR`-`BROO`-`NEWY`-`CHAR`-`NASH`, and this for both directions.
Then, you must also configure OSPF weights such that the links `STLO`-`PITT` and `PITT`-`NEWY` 
are only used as backup. 

<p align="center">
<img src="uploads/b54a5efa3c289ab8841b558a08030a36/loadbalancing.png" width="600"/>
</p>

:pencil: **To include in your report:** List all the OSPF weights you
used. Then, include the results of a `traceroute` from `CHIC-host` to 
`NASH-host` and from `NEWY-host` to `STLO-host`. Comment the results of your `traceroutes`: 
do you see what you expect according to the weights you have configured, why?

#### Question 1.4 (1.25 point)

In this question, your goal is to enable hosts in Data Center 1 to communicate with hosts in Data Center 2
using IPv6 through a 6in4 tunnel.
To do that, you will first have to configure an IPv6 address as well as an IPv6 default gateway in each
host of both Data Centers.
Then, as the routing within your AS is only performed for IPv4, you will have to configure 
a 6in4 tunnel between the two Data Centers to enable hosts to communicate with each other.

_Configuration of the IPv6 addresses and default gateway:_ You will have to use one distinct
IPv6 prefix for each Data Center. More precisely, in Data Center 1
you must use the IPv6 subnet `X:200::/32` whereas in Data Center 2 you must use the IPv6 subnet `X:201::/32`.
Within each Data Center, you are free to assign any IPv6 address you would like to any host, as long 
as they belong to these IPv6 subnets. However, keep in mind that the hosts of `SpaceX` and `NASA`
are in different VLANs, and thus for each Data Center, you should also divide your IPv6 subnet into
two different subnets, one for each VLAN, as you did in Question 1.1. Finally, as for IPv4, you need to 
configure `NEWY` to be the IPv6 default gateway for hosts in Data Center 1 and `STLO` to be the IPv6 default 
gateway for hosts in Data Center 2.

_Configuration of the 6in4 tunnel:_ The 6in4 tunnel must be configured between `NEWY` and `STLO`.
With the 6in4 tunnel, when a host in Data Center 1 sends an IPv6 packet to a host in Data Center 2, 
`NEWY` (the ingress of the tunnel) encapsulates the packet into an IPv4 header. The packet is routed
based on the IPv4 header to the egress of the tunnel, here `STLO`. `STLO` removes the IPv4 header 
and forwards the original packet to the Data Center 2 network. The original IPv6 packet then arrives
to the destination host via l2-based forwarding. The same principle is used when sending a packet
from Data Center 2 to Data Center 1. In this case, `STLO` is the ingress of the tunnel and `NEWY` the egress.
We explain in the tutorial how to configure 6in4 tunnels with linux. 

> You will have to configure two 6in4 tunnels, on from `NEWY` to `STLO` and one from `STLO` to `NEWY` (it is useful for the next questions).

As it is not possible to configure 6in4 tunnels with FRR, you will have to do this using the linux
commands available with `bash`. To run `bash` on a router instead of its CLI, use the `goto.sh` script 
and write `container` as second argument (instead of `router` or `host`). From there, you can
execute linux commands in the router to setup the 6in4 tunnels.

:point_right: Use the loopback address of the routers NEWY and STLO for the two ends of the tunnels.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Show the output of an IPv6 `traceroute`
between `SpaceX_2` and `NASA_4` and explain what do you observe. Then, run at the same time
a `ping` from `SpaceX_3` to `NASA_4` and a `tcpdump` in the `NEWY` `container` on the interface
where the traffic destined to DC2 is sent  (use the `-i` option of `tcpdump` to specify on which interface you want to listen, and the `-n` to not resolve the IP addresses). Show the output of the `tcpdump`
which shows the 6in4 tunnel in action, and describe what you observe.

#### Question 1.5 (0.5 point)

The hosts in Data Center 1 and 2 need a low delay between them. As a result, you would like
the traffic between Data Center 1 and 2 to use the shortest path in terms of number of hops
which is `NEWY`-`PITT`-`STLO`. 

Configure the routers such that the path `NEWY`-`PITT`-`STLO` is used for the traffic between the
two Data Centers, and **only** for this traffic. The load-balancing configured
in the previous question should still work. Since in the last question, you configured the 6in4 tunnels between the loopback interfaces of the routers `NEWY` and `STLO`, this question essentially consists in routing the traffic between those two loopback addresses on the link `NEWY`-`PITT`-`STLO`.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Explain how you configured the routers 
to solve this question and discuss potential drawbacks of your solution.
Then, show the result of a `traceroute` from `NEWY-host` to `STLO-host`, and the result of a `traceroute` from DC1 to DC2 (pick the host you want within each Data Center). Is the traffic flowing on the path `NEWY`-`PITT`-`STLO` really _only_ DC-to-DC traffic?

### Inter-Domain Routing (1.5 point)

#### Question 2.1 (0.5 point)

Configure internal BGP sessions (iBGP) between all pairs of routers (full-mesh).
Verify that each one of your routers does have an iBGP session with all the other routers with
the command `show ip bgp summary`.

When you establish a BGP session, you must use the loopback
address for each endpoint of the connection. The loopback address is a virtual
address that is always up as long as the router is running. Using the loopback
interface instead of any other physical interface prevents the BGP session to go down
if a physical interface becomes unavailable.
To use loopback addresses for your BGP sessions, you will have to use the
`update-source` command when you configure the internal BGP sessions.
We explain why and how to configure it in our FRRouting tutorial.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Explain what `update-source` does
and why you have to use it. Show the result of a `show ip bgp summary` for the router `NASH`.

#### Question 2.2 (1 point)

Configure the external BGP sessions (eBGP) with your neighboring ASes (including the IXPs).
Normally, you would need to negotiate with your neighboring ASes and agree on which IP addresses should
be used by you and your peer during the hackathon. This year, we provide you these IP addresses
alongside the information about where and with whom you are
supposed to have an eBGP session. You can find this information in the [as_connections](https://comm-net.ethz.ch/routing_project/as_connections) file. 
For every eBGP session, the file shows its type (peer2peer, customer2provider or provider2customer),
which router is connected to the neighboring AS, and what IP address (and subnet) you should
use for the interface in __your__ router.
The snapshot of the file below is an example of what the AS connections file
tells you if you are group 6 (AS 6).

```
6   DETR    customer2provider   3   179.0.38.2/24
6   CHIC    customer2provider   4   179.0.40.2/24
6   STLO    peer2peer           5   179.0.44.2/24
6   CHAR    provider2customer   7   179.0.46.1/24
6   NASH    provider2customer   8   179.0.45.1/24
6   BROO    peer2peer         126   180.126.0.6/24
```

Based on this snapshot, we can see that AS 6 
has two peers (AS5 and IXP126), two customers (AS7 and AS8) and two providers (AS3 and AS4).
As an illustration, AS6 has one connection with AS4 via its router `CHIC` and
where the IP address of the interface is `179.0.40.2/24`. AS6 is connected to its customer AS7 via
its router `CHAR`, and uses the IP address `179.0.46.1/24`. The neighboring AS, AS 7 uses the IP address `179.0.46.2/24`.
This you can see when you look at the corresponding line of AS 7:

```
7   DETR   customer2provider   6   179.0.46.2/24
```

AS6 is also connected to the IXP126 via its router `BROO`. In this case, you must
configure the IP address `180.126.0.6/24` on the interface of `BROO` connected to the IXP.
In our Internet, the AS number of an IXP is its identification number.
For example, IXP126 has the AS number 126. The IP address of the IXP
route server is `180.Z.0.Z` with Z the IXP number. The route server
of IXP126, for example, has the IP address `180.126.0.126`.

> By default, we have configured the IXPs to not relay your BGP advertisements to
their other peers. Thus, it is normal if you do not see your prefixes advertised through the IXP. We will take care of that in question 3.2.

Once the eBGP sessions are up, advertise your prefix to your peers.
You must only advertise the /8 that has been assigned to you.
In the mean time, your peers should advertise to you their /8 prefix,
as well as all the /8 prefixes they have learned (since there are no BGP policies yet).

> [Recall](../2.-Tutorial/2.5-Configuring-IP-routers/2.5.5-Configure-BGP) that you will need to configure a static route to Null0 for your /8 prefix, otherwise your routers won't advertise your /8 prefix with BGP. 

:bulb: To answer this question, you will have to use the `next-hop-self`
command when you configure the external BGP sessions. We explain why and how to
configure it in our [FRRouting tutorial](../2.-Tutorial/2.5-Configuring-IP-routers/2.5.5-Configure-BGP).

**Reminder**: The IP address of the IXP Route Server is `180.Z.0.Z` with Z the IXP number.

> To check whether a BGP session is working and a connection has been established,
> you can use the command `show ip bgp summary`. You will see a list of all BGP neighbors. If there
> is a time entry in the column `Up/Down`, then the session has successfully been established.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** 
Explain what `next-hop-self` does and why you have to use it using an example in your own network.
Also, explain on which BGP sessions `next-hop-self` is required.
Then, show us the results of a `show ip bgp` for the router `CHAR`. You should see the prefixes
advertised by your neighboring ASes, which would indicate that your eBGP sessions
are correctly configured and that the advertisements are correctly propagated through
your iBGP sessions.
Then, show us that your neighboring ASes do receive the advertisement for your
/8 prefix. To do that, show in your report the result of the looking glass for
one router located in a neighboring AS. You should see your prefix in the looking glass.
Finally, show us that you have data-plane connectivity with your neighbors by
showing the result of a `traceroute` from your `PITT-host`
to the `PITT-host` of one of your neighboring ASes.

:information_source: Tier1 ASes do not have a router in `PITT`. Thus, if your are connected to a Tier1 AS, you should launch the `traceroute` towards your customers. 

### Policy Routing (4.5 points + 0.5 bonus points)

#### Question 3.1 (2 points)

Configure your local-preference as well as the exportation rules to implement
the customer/provider and peer/peer business relationships with your
neighbors (see the Gao-Rexford [paper](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sylvia/cs268-2019/papers/gao-rexford.pdf)).
The connections you have through your IXP must be
considered as peer-to-peer connections.

> Keep in mind that the default behaviour of the IXP Route Server is to not relay the BGP advertisements, thus  for now the prefixes you advertise to your IXP will not be propagated to the other IXP's participants. Yet, you can already configure the exportation rules for the eBGP session you have with your IXP. We will verify that it works in question 3.2.

:bulb: To configure the exportation rules, you can tag incoming routes using BGP
communities to keep track of where the routes have been learned,
and then match on the tag when exporting the routes.
We advice you to verify with `traceroutes` or with the looking glass
that the paths used do respect the business relationships.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Briefly explain 
what BGP communities you used for your peers, customers and providers.
Then show a screenshot of one `in` and one `out` route-map
and briefly explain the different lines in the route-map.
Then, show that your configuration works properly by adding the result of the looking glass of your direct peer, which is supposed to show that this peer does receive the prefixes of
your customers, but does not receive the prefixes of your providers and peers.
Finally, use the `measurement` container to launch a `traceroute` from one of your providers towards one of your customers.

:exclamation: For groups that are connected to a Tier1 AS, instead of launching a `traceroute` from a provider towards one of your customers, launch the `traceroute` from a **peer** towards one of your customers (Tier1 ASes are not connected to the measurement container, so you can't launch `traceroute` from them). Make sure to start the `traceroute` from a peer that is supposed to send the traffic to you to reach your customer. For example if you are AS 3, you can start the `traceroute` from AS 24 towards AS 6. However, if you launch it from AS 4 to AS 6, then the traffic might not go through your AS because of the implemented BGP policy in AS 4.
Note that you may only be able to run that `traceroute` after configuring the BGP session with the IXP (Question 3.2).

<!-- The targeted peer should be one that is reachable through the IXP (because to reach the directly connected peer, _e.g.,_ AS5 if you are AS6, the customer might use the direct link it has with it, _e.g.,_ the link between AS7 and AS5). For instance if you are AS6, you should launch a `traceroute` from AS7 to AS103. 
Verify that your AS forwards the packet
directly to your peer and not to your provider. Include the result of the
`traceroute` in your report. -->


#### Question 3.2 (1 point)

By default, we have configured the IXPs to not relay your BGP advertisements to
their other peers. To announce a prefix to another peer via an IXP, you must
specify it using a BGP community value. IXPs are configured to relay a BGP advertisement
to a peer X if the advertisement has a community value equal to `N:X` with N the
IXP number. For example, if you are AS7 and you want to advertise a prefix
to AS28 via the IXP121, you must add the community value `121:28` in your BGP advertisements.

In this question, you must use the community values to send BGP advertisements to the peers connected to you through an IXP. However, for business reasons, you do **not** just want to peer with every other AS at the IXP.
You **do** want to peer through this
IXP with ASes that are located in another region. You **do not** want to peer through this IXP with ASes that are located in
the same region. To not peer through the IXP with ASes in the same region,
you must (i) not advertise them any prefixes and (ii) deny any advertisements
coming from them.

To check whether you properly configured (ii), we have configured
the stub ASes to advertise their prefix to all the ASes connected to their IXP.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Take a screenshot
of the relevant parts of the route-map at `BROO` used for eBGP session with your IXP
and explain what the different lines mean and do.
Show that the advertisement from the stub AS in the same region and
connected to the same IXP as you is denied by showing the result of a
`show ip bgp` in your router `BROO`.
For clarity, you do not need to write the full output, just the part that
is interesting (_i.e.,_ the part which could have the prefix of the stub AS).
Then, include in the report the output of the looking glass for the router `BROO`
of the stub AS in the same region and connected to the same IXP as you.
Then, include in your report the output of the looking glass for a group
in another region but connected to the IXP and which proves that your
prefix has been advertised through the IXP. When you include the output of a
looking glass in your report, only keep the parts that prove the correctness
of your configuration and omit the irrelevant ones.
Finally, use the measurement container to perform a `traceroute` from another AS (in another region)
to your AS for a destination where the traffic should go through the IXP.
Show the result in your report.

#### Question 3.3 (0.75 point)

In this question, the goal will be to configure your BGP policies in order to
influence the **inbound** traffic destined to your **own** prefix.
More precisely, your goal is to configure BGP policies such that the inbound traffic
coming from a provider and destined to your own prefix uses the provider connected
to `CHIC` in priority.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Explain in a few sentences the
technique you used and discuss any potential drawbacks. Then, include the result of the
looking glass for both of your providers. You can omit parts of the output
that are irrelevant, and only show the part that shows that your configuration
is correct (_i.e.,_ the part where your own prefix is shown).

#### Question 3.4 (active from 03.05.2021 on) (0.75 point)

As we have seen in the lecture, not all parties in the Internet play a fair
game. You realize that part of your /8 subnet is being hijacked by another AS.
In this question, you first have to figure out which prefix is being hijacked.
Then, you should try to nullify the ongoing attack and attract the hijacked
traffic back to your AS.

:information_source: to ensure full connectivity while configuring your eBGP sessions,
the hijacks will only be active during the last week of the project (starting from Monday, May 3rd).

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Explain how you found
the hijacked prefix space and describe your countermeasures. Would your current
solution to mitigate the hijack work for every possible hijack?

#### Bonus question 3.5 (0.5 point)

Although you can already connect to the mini-Internet over `ssh`, it would also be
interesting to directly connect one of *your* devices with the mini-Internet, e.g.
to test applications which run locally. To achieve that, you can use a VPN
service. Each group has three VPN servers running, one connected to `S1`,
one connected to `S2` and one connected to `S3`. Have a look at the tutorial file to
understand how you can connect a local VPN client with the mini-Internet.

The VPN traffic uses the VLAN number 30 in Data Center 1. Therefore,
extend the layer 2 configuration in DC1 as follow: First, make sure that you configure
the interface `BROO-L2.30` (on the `BROO` router) with the IP
`X.200.30.1/24`. Similarly, use the IP `X.200.30.2/24` on the interface
`NEWY-L2.30` in the `NEWY` router (X your group number). 
The two VPN servers already know that they should use these IP addresses as gateway.
Afterwards, extend your layer 2 trunk links to include the VLAN 30 and add the
VLAN tag 30 to the two interfaces connecting to the VPNs in `S1`, `S2` and `S3`.
Finally, follow the tutorial document to get a working VPN connection from a
local device.

:pencil: **In the report, answer the following questions:**
- Just after establishing the VPN connection, which prefix space of the
mini-Internet are you able to reach from your local device?
- What do you have to configure locally in order to be able to ping a
host outside of your AS (using the VPN connection)?
- Assuming you want to ping the host connected to NASH in your network
from your local device (using the VPN). How could you confirm that your
command `ping X.108.0.1` (run locally) is indeed going over the VPN
and reaches the NASH host inside the mini-Internet and not an actual server
in the real Internet with the IP `X.107.0.1` (X your group number)?
- Now a second group member establishes a VPN connection towards the
other VPN server on a different local device while the first VPN connection
is still running. Perform a `traceroute` between the two VPN endpoints over
the mini-Internet. Explain which path the traffic takes.
