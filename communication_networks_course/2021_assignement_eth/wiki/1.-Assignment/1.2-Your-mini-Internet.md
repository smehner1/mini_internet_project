Similarly to real networks, your network spans over layer-2 (using switches)
and layer-3 (using routers). Your network also connects (at layer-3) to other
networks, creating an Internet. We now describe each aspect of the network topology.

### L2 topology

You operate two layer-2 networks, which are named Data Center 1 and Data Center 2
and which are depicted in the figure below. 
Data Center 1 is composed of three switches named `S1`, `S2`, and `S3`. Data Center 2
is composed of one switch named `S4`.
The switch `S1` is connected to the layer-3 router `BROO`, the switch `S2` is 
connected to the layer-3 router `NEWY` and the switch `S4` is connected to the layer-3 router `STLO`.
The three routers can act as a gateway, meaning that a host in _e.g.,_ Data Center 1
must forward a packet to either `BROO` or `NEWY` to reach any non-local destination. The 
routers will then take care of sending that packet to the destination.

</p>

The hosts in your Data Centers belong to two of your customers: `SpaceX` and `NASA`.
Each switch is connected to one `SpaceX` host and one `NASA` host.
Within Data Center 1, hosts will have an IPv4 address in the subnet `X.200.0.0/23`
and an IPv6 address in the subnet `X:200::/32` whereas in Data Center 2, hosts will
only have an IPv6 address in the subnet `X:201::/32` (X is the group number). 


### L3 topology

For this project, imagine that the two Data Centers are part
of an AS spanning across the Northeastern United States.
In addition to the two Data Centers, you will also have to manage this AS.
Your AS number is your group number: _e.g.,_ AS 28 for group 28. Your AS
has routers located in different cities: Brooklyn, New York, Charlotte, Pittsburgh,
Detroit, Chicago, Saint Louis and Nashville (see the figure below).

</p>


Every AS has been allocated one /8 prefix that it can use internally.
If you are group X, then the prefix `X.0.0.0/8` is yours, meaning that group 48
has the prefix `48.0.0.0/8`. You will use this IP space to allocate IP addresses
to your hosts and routers.
Finally, one host is connected to each router (not shown in the figure for clarity).

> Please note that the Tier1 ASes, which are operated by the TA team, have a smaller topology, with only two routers, `BROO` and `NEWY`.


### Internet (AS-level) topology

Every router, but the ones at `NEWY` and `PITT`, has an external connection to
one of your neighboring ASes. Some are connected to a provider, some to a customer and 
others to a peer. `BROO` is connected to an Internet eXchange Point (IXP).
You will have to establish eBGP sessions on these external links.
The figure below shows the mini-Internet topology you will end up building.

</p>

The red ASes (1, 2, etc.) are all Tier1 ASes, meaning their
neighboring ASes are either peers or customers. The grey ASes (11, 12, etc.) are stub ASes, 
meaning their neighboring ASes are either peers or providers but they have no customers. 
We (the TA team) will take care of the Tier1 ASes as well as the stub ASes. 

The Transit ASes (blue ASes) have peers, customers and
providers. For example, group 5 has two providers (3 and 4), two peers (6 and
the IXP 121) and two customers (7 and 8). 

There are seven IXPs within our mini-Internet. The primary purpose of an IXP
is to allow networks to interconnect directly. One advantage of using an
IXP is that an AS can directly peer with another AS through the IXP, instead of
reaching it via a provider that it has to pay. Another advantage is that only one
physical connection with an
IXP is needed to potentially interconnect with all the other IXP participants.
An IXP uses a BGP Route Server to advertise prefixes between its participants.

One IXP is connected to all the
Tier1 ASes, allowing them to be connected in a full-mesh fashion.
The other IXPs are always interconnecting two different regions.
This enables two ASes in different regions to peer between
them (as long as they respect the BGP customer/provider policies),
instead of using (and paying!) their providers. The following example illustrates the
benefit of being connected to an IXP: AS6 can send traffic
to AS105 via the IXP126, instead of paying AS 4 to send the traffic via the path
4-2-101-103-105 if IXP126 is not used.
