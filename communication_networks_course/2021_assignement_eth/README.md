Unlike for 2020 and 2019, we use a [GitLab wiki](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/wiki/) for the assignment.
The wiki is basically a separate git repository with markdown files. Simply push the files in the `wiki` directory to your git 
repo for your GitLab wiki and will see the assignment. You can also just look at the files directly from the `wiki` directory.
